         ARGUMENT PASSING
         ================

None.

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

We changed the logic of process_execute () method to tokenize the file
name into the space delimited tokens. The first token is the command name
and the remaining string are the space separated arguments. These are
further tokenized in start_process () and both the command name and the
arguments are passed to setup_stack () along with the arguments count

Arguments are pushed in the right order by counting down from the
arguments pointer passed till the number of arguments is reached. We
prevent stack overflow by decrementing the stack pointer by the length of
the arguments before inserting it.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

strtok_r is a reentrant version of strtok. The key difference between the
two functions is that where strtok uses a global variable between calls to
store state, strtok_r uses a save pointer to maintain context. The reason
why Pintos probably implements strtok_r and not strtok is strtok_r is a
threadsafe version of strtok

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name

The two advantages of splitting commands into executable name and
arguments in the shell instead of the kernel are:

  1. The kernel has to do less work. This not only allows the kernel code
     to be simpler, it is also in line with the Unix philosophy which says
     that programs should do one thing and do it well

  2. The shell can not only perform the splitting of the commands but can
     also perform basic checks and validations on the arguments supplied.
     This in turn results in less overhead for the kernel

           ============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

We introduced a new data structure in thread.h to store information about
the child thread's status:

  struct child_thread_status {
    tid_t tid;
    int load_status;
    int exit_code;
    bool has_wait_called;
    struct list_elem child_elem;
    struct semaphore wait_sema;
    struct semaphore load_sema;
  };

In addition to the above data structure, we modified the thread struct
to include the following fields:

  * struct thread *parent;
  - Reference to the parent thread

  * struct list child_threads;
  - A list containing the references of the children of the current
    thread

  * struct list files;
  - A list containing the list of open file descriptors by the thread

  * int next_fd;
  - An integer variable to keep track of the next available FD ID


We created a new data structure in syscall_impl.h to store the details
about file descriptors:

  struct file_descriptor {
    int fid;
    struct file *file_ref;
    struct list_elem file_elem;
  };

We also added the following variables in syscall_impl.h:

  * struct lock filesystem_lock;
  - A global lock that must be acquired by a thread before performing
    filesystem operations

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

Each file has a unique file descriptor associated with it. The file
descriptor is unique per process

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

The below steps are performed while reading user data from the kernel:

  1. Check the validity of the buffer and buffer + size pointers
  2. If both pointers are valid, proceed to step 3. Else exit with status
    -1
  3. Dereference the pointers and perform the filesystem operation
     requested
  4. If a page fault occurs, gracefully terminate the process instead of
     causing kernel panic

We do not write data to the kernel

pagedir_get_page() returns kernel virtual address for specified frame and
NULL pointer if no mapping is found

Full Page Copy:

If the page is continuous then pagedir_get_page() for the first time
itself will provide needed level of inspection for the kernel that address
provided by user is valid. If page is in form of chunks and assuming
smallest chunk size is 1 byte, then 4096 inspections are required

2 Bytes Copy:
If the page is continuous then pagedir_get_page() for the first time
itself will provide needed level of inspection for the kernel that address
provided by user is valid. If page is in form of chunks and assuming
smallest chunk size is 1 byte, then 2 inspections are required.

No scope of improvement as per our current understanding

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

The "wait" system call is internally implemented using process_wait. This
in turn is implemented using a binary semaphore. Whenever a thread calls
wait on another thread, it decrements the counter to below zero, thereby
blocking it. This prevents the parent thread from being scheduled while
the child thread is running. When a child is done executing, it updates
it's exit code inside the exit_code variable within the reference of
itself maintained by the parent thread. It then increments the semaphore
by 1, bringing the counter to zero and unblocking the main thread. The main
thread can then lookup the exit code of the child that exited in the list
maintained by it

Our first line of defense is to validate all pointers before accessing
them. If any of the pointers are invalid, then we terminate the process
and return status -1. Even after all these checks, if errors do occur,
we trap them using the page_fault_exception routine, terminate the process
and return status as -1

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed

>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

Each child thread contains a binary semaphore called load_sema which is
initialized to 0. The "exec" system call is implemented using
process_exec (). Whenever "exec" is called, the load semaphore is
decremented by 1 causing the parent thread to block. The newly created
child thread is then scheduled and runs. Once the child thread has loaded
(successfully or unsuccessfully) it updates it's load_status value in
the reference of itself maintained by the parent thread. It then
increments the value of the load semaphore causing it to reach zero
and unblocking the parent thread. The parent thread can then safely
fetch the load status of the child thread.

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you

>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

Case 1: P calls wait(C) BEFORE C exits

  P decrements the wait semaphore causing it to fall below 0, thereby
  blocking P. When C has finished execution, it sets its exit status
  inside P's reference of C and increments the wait semaphore causing
  P to resume execution again

Case 2: P calls wait(C) AFTER C exits

  In this case, C will have incremented the wait semaphore by 1 before
  exiting and it's value will be at 1. It will have also set it's status
  inside P's reference of C. Thus when P eventually does call wait (C),
  it will perform the decrement operation on the wait semaphore. However,
  this will only reduce it to 0 and thus not block P. It can then safely
  retrieve C's exit code from C's reference in the child_threads list

Case 3: P terminates without waiting BEFORE C exits

  This can happen only if P was killed by the kernel before it could
  invoke wait (C). In this case, eventually when C does exit, it will try
  to locate its parent to set it's exit code and fail to do so. It will
  skip updating it's status in the parent variable and exit gracefully

Case 4: P terminates without waiting AFTER C exits

  This will happen only if P is killed by the kernel after C has exited
  and before P could invoke wait (C). In this case, all resources used
  by P will be freed

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

Access to user memory from the kernel is implemented by validating the
user pointers before accessing them. The reason we chose this approach is
because it is simple to understand and trivial to implement. We also
added a second layer of defense by checking for userspace violations
whenever a page fault occurs and gracefully exiting instead of
triggering kernel panic

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

Advantages:

- Since file descriptors are maintained on a per process level, we
  instead of at the OS level, we achieve better isolation and
  security as well as avoid the hassle of checking ownership permissions
  before any operation is performed

Disadvantages:

- Since file descriptors are at a per process level, there might be
  multiple references of the same file if it's opened by different
  processes. This results in a greater memory footprint, especially
  if the number of processes requesting a file is particularly high

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

We didn't change it
